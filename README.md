This shows the world's happiest people by country (2015, 2016, 2017).

I am analyzing this data to find the happiest place on Earth and the determining factors.
I downloaded this data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness). I used the happiness Rank, which was determined by the Happiness Score, to identify the top happiest countries. Then I used the scores from the other columns to show why Switzerland is the happiest country.
